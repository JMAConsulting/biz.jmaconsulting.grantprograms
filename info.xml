  <description>Applications will be received via CiviGrants functionality. Administrators will have to set an assessment score which will decide the amount to be granted for each grant submitted by the applicant.
Amount to be granted will be decided based on the remainder amount present in each grant program for that year and by an algorithm that does a trial, and ultimately a final allocation.
Grants which have been allocated and approved for payment can be selected and paid. Checks will be printed for paid grants and PDF/CSV reports will be generated for the same.</description>
